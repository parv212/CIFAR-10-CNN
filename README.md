# CIFAR-10-CNN

This GitHub repository is dedicated to the project of image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The project involves applying two distinct deep learning models: one with a convolutional layer and another without. The CIFAR-10 dataset, comprising 60,000 images across 10 categories, serves as the basis for training and testing these models.

Key aspects of the project include:

* **Deep Neural Network with Convolution Layer:** Utilizing convolution, pooling, dropout layers, and dense layers to extract and classify image features, achieving a validation accuracy of 73.74%.
* **Deep Neural Network without Convolution Layer:** Implementing a flattened neural network approach for image classification, highlighting the differences in performance compared to convolutional models.
* **Comparative Analysis:** Demonstrating the superiority of convolutional methods in image classification tasks, with detailed insights on training and validation accuracies and losses.
* **Libraries and Tools Used:** Employing Keras, TensorFlow, and other relevant Python libraries for model development and evaluationâ€‹.
