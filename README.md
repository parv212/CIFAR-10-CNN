# CIFAR-10-CNN

The aim was to apply a CNN model in python to the well-known CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset is well-known and easy to use. The data has a total of 60,000 images and has a split of 83% and 17% into train and test data respectively. Further, a CNN model was developed with 4 convolutional layers, Max pooling, and 3 Dense layers. Training and Validation accuracy graphs were a plot to check for overfitting.
